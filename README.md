# Blackâ€“Scholes Option Pricing ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ  

Welcome to my implementation of the **Blackâ€“Scholes option pricing model**!  
This project brings the theory of options to life â€” pricing European calls and puts, computing the **Greeks** for risk analysis, and even solving for **implied volatility** using numerical methods.  

The code implementation is in the C++ file (black-scholes.cpp) and a bit of the theory is in the notebook (Black_Scholes.ipynb).

Hope you enjoy!
