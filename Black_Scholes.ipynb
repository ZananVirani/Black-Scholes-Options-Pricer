        "\n",
        "1. **Efficient Markets**  \n",
        "   Markets are frictionless, with no transaction costs or taxes, and prices reflect all available information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Lognormal Price Distribution**  \n",
        "   The underlying asset price follows a **geometric Brownian motion** with constant drift and volatility, resulting in a lognormal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Constant Volatility**  \n",
        "   The volatility of the underlying asset, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$, is known and remains constant over the life of the option.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Constant Risk-Free Rate**  \n",
        "   The risk-free interest rate, $\\mathbf{r}$, is constant and known.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **No Dividends (or Continuous Dividends)**  \n",
        "   The model either assumes no dividends, or that dividends are paid continuously at a known yield, $\\mathbf{q}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **European-Style Options**  \n",
        "   Options can only be exercised at expiration (European exercise), not before.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **No Arbitrage**  \n",
        "   There are no opportunities for riskless profit in the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Frictionless Trading**  \n",
